# Mxterm
This is a another archive of the now hard to find mxterm, my intrest in it is because it's a motif terminal emulator, and about the only one left.

Currently it comes up with the error of "xterm: no available ptys: No such file or directory" on MacOSX big sur 
from the pkgsrc package manager, if anybody has an idea to fix it; please do ask me, it seems to be a repeated cryptic error i've seen before. And
If there was a anwser, it's lost or gone now.

## Notes:
Main is main, any pushes to classic will be ignored.

Fair warning: xTerm is a very eldritch terminal emulator already by itself, any simplfications to mXterm will be wellcome here. Also mind the motif
toolkit used here, due to a compromise made in the conceiving of motif itself, the motif parts may also be hard to read. to see more about this state
of affairs, see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xterm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motif_(software)
