#Mxterm#
This is a another archive of the now hard to find mxterm, my intrest in it is because it's a motif terminal emulator, and about the only one left.

Currently it comes up with the error of "xterm: no available ptys: No such file or directory" on MacOSX big sur 
from the pkgsrc package manager, if anybody has an idea to fix it; please do ask me, it seems to be a repeated cryptic error i've seen before. And
If there was a anwser, it's lost or gone now.

Main is main, any pushes to classic will be ignored.
