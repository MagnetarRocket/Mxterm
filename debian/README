hello!

my name is ali akcaagac. i'm a student of computer & economics science here
in germany. now that we all can get the fine openmotif, most people also
requested a new mxterm, that never was updated since 1993. the only mxterm
that i know of was from metrolink. unfortunately you have to buy it with
their metrolink motif. i don't realy know if you can get it for free.

i layed my hands on the old patches from 1993. modified them and applied them
to the current version of xterm. yes now you can expect new mxterm versions
every time another xterm comes out. only by patching the original code with
the old bugfixed and modified patches. please keep in mind that i took some
hours getting all these stuff working. the xterm package really sucks. never
seen such a hack ;).

at least mxterm works fine for me. i don't know if this will do at your
machine aswell. just try it out. a last hint. this was xterm that comes with
the xfree86 v4.0 archive. i haven't checked it with an standalone version.
just get xf4.x and apply the patches yourself and or compile this archive.

here some compile and install guide.

1) depack the archive and make sure you got openmotif
2) enter the mxterm directory and enter "./configure --prefix=/usr/X11R6"
   please don't use the "--enable-toolbar" option, this cause trouble with
   motif. you don't need to enable anything more. mxterm will be made directly
   out of the box. the other options in "./configure" should work aswell and
   won't harm mxterm (but not the --enable-toolbar option).
3) run "make"
4) it might be (for non linux users) that compiling will abort in link
   sequence, it might tell you for unresolved links or such garbage, this
   might be that your machine use a different way linking the motif libraries
   if this happens, then please edit "Makefile.in" search for "-lXm -lXp" and
   replace them with all kind of libaries that your machine need to compile
   other motif applications and then go to step 2) again.
5) "make install" installs mxterm to your X11R6 directory.

btw: there's a scrollbarbug in the original xterm, that also occour in mxterm.
     i want to tell you about, so it's not my fault at all. when you have your
     scrollbar placed at the right side and turn scrollbar on/off with the
     menu, the scrollbar get displaced. tell the programmers of xterm to fix
     that. resizing the window will fix that problem again.
